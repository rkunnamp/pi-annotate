# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Added `pi-package` keyword for npm discoverability (pi v0.50.0 package system)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-24

### Added

- `/annotate` command for user-initiated annotation mode
  - Run `/annotate` to connect and open toolbar on current tab
  - Run `/annotate <url>` to navigate and open toolbar
  - Fire-and-forget: opens toolbar immediately, annotations sent via `USER_MESSAGE`

- **Screenshot capture** (3 modes)
  - **Viewport capture**: Click viewport icon to capture entire visible page
  - **Area capture**: Click crop icon, then drag to select a region
  - **Element capture**: Check "Include screenshot" in annotation popup to capture the element
  - All screenshots included as base64 PNG in tool results
  - Visual feedback with screenshot badge showing count

### Fixed

- Element screenshots now correctly use viewport coordinates for cropping (was incorrectly using document coordinates which caused misaligned captures on scrolled pages)
- Standalone screenshots (viewport/area) now included in `USER_MESSAGE` for command flow (previously only sent via `ANNOTATIONS_COMPLETE` in tool flow)

### Changed

- **Browser-first workflow**: Connection now established via `/annotate` command, then toolbar can be toggled anytime with extension icon or `Cmd+Shift+A`
- Made `id` optional in `START_ANNOTATION` message to differentiate command vs tool flow
- Updated README with new usage instructions and method table
- Added `Screenshot` type and `screenshots` field to `AnnotationResult`
- Added `screenshots` field to `USER_MESSAGE` socket message type
