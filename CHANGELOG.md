# Changelog

All notable changes to Pi Annotate.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed
- **Silent failure on restricted tabs** — When invoked on `chrome://`, `about:`, or other restricted URLs, the agent now gets an immediate error instead of hanging for 5 minutes
- **No active tab** — If no browser tab is available, returns an error immediately instead of failing silently
- **Popup/shortcut on fresh tabs** — "Start Annotation" button and keyboard shortcut now inject the content script automatically on tabs where it hasn't loaded yet
- **Annotation UI not dismissed on abort/timeout** — Content script now handles incoming `CANCEL` messages (from agent abort or tool timeout) and closes the annotation UI

### Added
- **New tab fallback** — When current tab is restricted and a URL is provided, opens a new tab instead of failing
- **`isRestrictedUrl()` helper** — Detects `chrome://`, `chrome-extension://`, `edge://`, `about:`, `devtools://`, `view-source:` URLs
- **`injectAfterLoad()` helper** — Shared load-wait + inject pattern used by both navigate and create-tab paths
- **`togglePicker()` function** — Single entry point for popup button and keyboard shortcut, routes through background script with automatic content script injection

### Changed
- **Popup button simplified** — Routes through background script instead of injecting directly, eliminating duplicated injection logic
- **`sendToContentScript` reports errors** — On injection failure, sends `CANCEL` back to native host with error details instead of swallowing the error
- **`onMessage` log label** — Changed from `"From content:"` to `"Message:"` since popup messages now route through the same handler

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-28

### Added
- **DevTools-level context capture** — Automatically captures diagnostic info to reduce need for manual DevTools inspection
- **Box model breakdown** — Content dimensions, padding, border, and margin for each element
- **Accessibility info** — Role (implicit or explicit), accessible name, description, focusable state, ARIA states
- **Debug mode toggle** — New "Debug" checkbox in toolbar enables additional captures:
  - **Computed styles** — 40+ key CSS properties (layout, flex, grid, colors, typography, etc.)
  - **Parent context** — Parent element's tag, classes, and layout-relevant styles
  - **CSS variables** — Custom properties used by the element (up to 50)
- **Full screenshot badges** — When using "Full" screenshot mode, numbered teal badges are now drawn directly on the screenshot at each selected element's position, making it easy to correlate elements with the numbered list in the output

### Changed
- **Expanded attributes** — Now captures ALL attributes instead of just 8 hardcoded ones
- **Output format** — Enhanced with box model, attributes, and accessibility in compact format

### Fixed
- **Attributes not displayed** — Bug fix: `attributes` field was captured but never output in `formatResult()`

### Technical
- Added `BoxModel`, `AccessibilityInfo`, `ParentContext` interfaces to `types.ts`
- Added 12 new helper functions with JSDoc annotations in `content.js`
- CSS variable discovery with recursive rule extraction and caching
- Reset debug mode and CSS cache in `resetState()`
- Added `addBadgesToScreenshot()` canvas function for full screenshot badge overlay

## [0.2.1] - 2026-01-28

### Added
- **Dark/Light theme support** — Auto-detects system preference via `prefers-color-scheme`
- **CSS custom properties** — 22 `--pi-*` variables for consistent theming aligned with pi interview tool
- **Element bounding boxes** — Selected elements now show visible outline rectangles
- **Expand/Contract buttons** — ▲/▼ buttons in note card headers to navigate parent/child elements
- **`isPiElement()` helper** — Top-level function to detect pi-annotate UI elements
- **`updateNoteCardLabel()` helper** — Reusable function for updating note card selectors

### Changed
- **Status updates** — Replaced `console.log` with `ctx.ui.setStatus("pi-annotate", message)` for proper pi integration
- **Screenshot toggle labels** — Changed from `Each|Full|None` to `Screenshot: Crop|Full|None` for clarity
- **Notes visibility toggle** — Replaced two buttons (▼▲) with single checkbox `☑ Notes`
- **Camera button styling** — Now shows clear on/off state (40% opacity when off, green glow when on)
- **Color palette** — Unified with pi interview tool (teal accent `#8abeb7`, consistent grays)

### Fixed
- **setStatus called before validation** — Moved status update after message type check in `handleMessage()`

### Technical
- Added `currentCtx` variable to store context for status updates in async callbacks
- Extracted duplicated pi-element detection logic into single `isPiElement()` function
- Extracted duplicated note card label update into `updateNoteCardLabel()` function
- All 96 hardcoded colors replaced with CSS variables
- Light theme overrides defined in `@media (prefers-color-scheme: light)` block

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-27

### Added
- **Inline note cards** — Each selected element gets a floating note card with its own textarea for per-element comments
- **Draggable notes** — Drag note cards by their header to reposition them anywhere on screen
- **Clickable badges** — Click numbered badges to toggle note cards open/closed
- **SVG connectors** — Curved dashed lines connect note cards to their elements
- **Scroll to element** — Click selector in note card header to scroll element into view with highlight flash
- **Expand/Collapse all** — Toolbar buttons to open or close all notes at once
- **Context input** — Simplified single-line input for overall context (replaces textarea)
- **Per-element comments** — `comment` field added to ElementSelection type for structured annotation data
- **Scroll/resize handlers** — Badges and connectors update when page scrolls or window resizes

### Changed
- **Panel simplified** — Removed chips section, added toolbar with mode toggles, screenshot options, and note controls
- **Markers → Badges** — Replaced green marker boxes with purple clickable badge circles
- **Auto-open notes** — Clicking an element automatically opens its note card and focuses the textarea
- **formatResult output** — "User's request" renamed to "Context", per-element comments shown under each element

### Removed
- **Chips UI** — Replaced entirely by inline note cards
- **Expand/contract per-chip** — Replaced by note card "remove" button and scroll-to-element

### Technical
- Added `elementComments`, `openNotes`, `notePositions`, `dragState` state variables
- Added `createNotesContainer`, `createNoteCard`, `toggleNote`, `updateBadges`, `updateConnectors`, `removeElement`, `scrollToElement`, `expandAllNotes`, `collapseAllNotes` functions
- Drag handlers use single document-level listeners to avoid memory leaks
- Note card event handlers use `getIndex()` to read from DOM (survives reindexing)
- `pruneStaleSelections` rebuilds note cards with correct indices after DOM changes

## [0.1.3] - 2026-01-27

### Added
- **Extension popup** — Click extension icon to see connection status, copy Extension ID and install command
- **PING/PONG health check** — Native host responds to PING for reliable connection detection
- **Click to copy selector** — Click hover preview or chip text to copy selector with "Copied!" tooltip
- **Screenshot mode toggle** — Choose between "Each element", "Full page", or "None" (replaces checkboxes)
- **Platform-aware UI** — Popup shows correct keyboard shortcuts for Mac vs Windows/Linux
- **Multi-terminal handling** — When another terminal runs `/annotate`, the old session is gracefully replaced with notification

### Changed
- **UI polish** — Removed section labels, tighter spacing, narrower right panel (160px vs 200px)
- **Fixed-height hover preview** — Single line with truncation prevents layout shift from long selectors
- **Centered arrow buttons** — ▲/▼ buttons now properly centered with larger icons
- **Options row** — Screenshot options moved inline with form elements, footer simplified

### Removed
- **+Add button** — Removed because hover changes when moving to click button (use Multi mode instead)
- **Checkbox toggles** — Replaced with unified screenshot mode toggle

### Fixed
- **Popup state handling** — Proper detection of connected/not-installed/trouble states
- **Click event propagation** — Click-to-copy works correctly with panel event handling
- **Session takeover** — New `/annotate` from different terminal properly resets UI state

## [0.1.2] - 2026-01-27

### Security
- **Auth token** — Native host generates per-run token at `/tmp/pi-annotate.token`; Pi must authenticate before messages are forwarded
- **Socket permissions** — Socket file created with 0600 permissions, token file with 0600
- **Message validation** — Schema guardrails in index.ts drop malformed messages

### Added
- **Request correlation** — End-to-end requestId tracking for proper multi-request handling

- **Log redaction** — Screenshots/dataUrls redacted from native host logs
- **Log rotation** — Host log rotates at 5MB
- **Stale selection pruning** — Auto-removes elements deleted from DOM before submit

### Fixed

- **Navigation timeout** — Now sends CANCEL with `navigation_timeout` reason to Pi
- **Canvas context guard** — Falls back to full screenshot if 2D context unavailable
- **escapeHtml robustness** — Handles null/undefined/non-string inputs safely

### Changed
- **Pending requests** — Changed from single `pendingResolve` to Map keyed by requestId

- **Tab routing** — Background script routes messages to correct tab via requestId mapping

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-27

### Fixed
- **XSS vulnerability** — Escape HTML when rendering element IDs/classes in tooltips and chips
- **Screenshot map index shift on click-deselect** — Clicking to deselect now properly shifts screenshot toggle states
- **DOM validity check** — Verify elements still exist in DOM before cropping screenshots
- **Null viewport access** — Guard against undefined viewport in result formatting
- **Event listener cleanup** — Match wheel event removal options with addition options
- **Navigation listener leak** — Add 30s timeout to prevent orphaned listeners
